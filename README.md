# Red-Card-Alert-6502-Assembly-
A 6502 Assembly program to be run on the VIC-20 emulator made for my CPSC599.82 course

Course Website:

  http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/599.82/

To assemble 6502 programs use the dasm assembler which can be downloaded at:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/dasm-dillon/
 
  Once downloaded use command line to navigate to the file's directory and use the command:
  
    dasm <filename>.asm -o<outfilename>.prg
  
  to assemble.
  
  *Note that you must add the ".prg" extension for the compiled program to be runnable on the VIC emulator

To run it you should download the VIC-20 Emulator at:
